<p><font size=5><strong>Yahoo!</strong></font>, used to be one of the biggest companies in the world. Yahoo! pioneered one of the first successful new business models on the Internet, the free content, paid advertising portal. (Kumar, 2016). Yahoo! started by two university students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, in 1994. At that time, the Internet was so unorganized that it took users hours to find a website. To solve this problem, Jerry and David made a list of some popular websites so that users can easily find them. This directory, “Jerry &amp; David’s guide to the world wide web”, soon be widely transformed and attracted thousands of views. In April 1994, Jerry &amp; David’s Guide to the world wide web was renamed Yahoo! (Yadav,2022). Yahoo attained its maximum valuation of almost $125 billion in 2000 and became one of the most valuable firms (Aufa,2019). However, due to various reasons, Yahoo! began to go downhill in the late 2000s, ending up being acquired by Verizon for $4.6 billion US dollars. The history could be a valuable lesson for entrepreneurs. This report is a case study of Yahoo!, and it concludes several reasons for its failure.</p>
<h1 id="No-Clear-Brand-Purpose-and-Positions"><a href="#No-Clear-Brand-Purpose-and-Positions" class="headerlink" title="No Clear Brand Purpose and Positions"></a><strong>No Clear Brand Purpose and Positions</strong></h1><p>Yahoo! lacked a clear vision of the company’s overall objectives. Yahoo is involved in a variety of services such as search, music, news, email, etc. The interweaving of these various services may have expanded Yahoo’s market reach to a certain extent, but it also led to a lack of clarity about the services it could provide to its users. When you talk about Google people think about search, when you talk about Facebook people think about social media, when you talk about eBay people think about auctions. When you talked about Yahoo! people think about nothing, users and even Yahoo! employees cannot clearly describe it in one word (Yadav, 2022). It has products in all kinds of areas and is beaten by different competitors in all sorts of areas. <strong>Yahoo! seems to be a jack-of-all-trades, but it is useless.</strong></p>
<p>Compared to Google, one of its competitors, although Google has various businesses, its main mission is clear and well known, that is, organise every information and make it universally accessible and useful to everyone. Google set this aim in the beginning of its history and still follows it today. On the contrary, Yahoo! never has such definitive goals. Due to the frequent changes in leadership, Yahoo!’s self-description changed 24 times in 24 years (The Wharton School,2016). Just as Yahoo! unable to explain to the market why it should exist, the company also has no idea which direction to move on. Without a focus on the business, Yahoo!’s failure seems to be a certainty.</p>
<p><strong>In addition to the lack of clarity on its service, Yahoo! cannot even describe its own type of company well.</strong> In the slow death throes of Yahoo!, leaders cannot decide whether this company is a media company or a technology company. One of the reasons Yahoo lost its early decade domination of the search business was due to its ambiguous attitude toward technology (Lee, 2013). Because Yahoo! focus too much on the benefits that media content and advertising bring, it pays less attention to the programming. While other companies have been capturing new markets by exploring new technologies, Yahoo has not been able to keep up with the market trends. Even Mayer, one of Yahoo!’s CEOs labelled Yahoo! as a ‘global technology company’, she still follows the operating logic of a media company, that is, following the trend does not create the trend. In this way, Yahoo! gradually abandoned by the market.</p>
<h1 id="Unsuccessful-acquisitions"><a href="#Unsuccessful-acquisitions" class="headerlink" title="Unsuccessful acquisitions"></a><strong>Unsuccessful acquisitions</strong></h1><p>Yahoo! never seems to succeed in acquisitions. <strong>It has not succeeded in buying Google and Facebook, which have great potential for future growth, at low prices, nor has it used the company it acquired for its own growth.</strong></p>
<p>In 1998, the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergei Brin, wanted to sell Google’s little startup algorithm to Yahoo!. This search engine would have helped Yahoo! consolidate its position in the search field. But Yahoo!, without long-term future vision, rejected this offer, sticking to its own content and platforms, as it could then make more money by selling advertising (Almalki, 2020). The truth is that its hierarchical search system, the “browse tree”, lacked any intelligent engine behind it and ended up looking stupid and useless which leads to Yahoo’s user churn and then its final failure (Ulanoff, 2016). In 2002, Yahoo again rejected Google’s offer to sell itself for $5 billion, which was also a terrible decision. Today, Google’s market capitalisation is over $120 billion.</p>
<p>The wrong decision was also made in the case of Yahoo!’s acquisition of Facebook. In 2006, Yahoo tried to buy Facebook for $1 billion, a price that Zuckerberg initially rejected. Reports indicate that if Yahoo raised the price to $1.1 billion, Facebook’s board would pressure Zuckerberg to agree to the deal. Yahoo! did not take this opportunity and instead lowered the price to $850 million. This offer was promptly rejected by the Facebook board (Almalki, 2020). Yahoo! thus, lost the opportunity to own one of the world’s most successful social media companies.</p>
<p>In addition to failing to acquire promising companies, <strong>Yahoo! has also failed miserably in running the companies it has acquired.</strong> In 1999, Yahoo! acquired two companies, Geocities and Broadcast.com. Geocities, which was purchased for $4.58 billion, was shut down in 2009, and Broadcast.com, which was acquired for $5.7 billion, also failed to deliver any returns.</p>
<p>Tumblr is a typical example of one of the many failed acquisitions by Yahoo!. Tumblr was the biggest acquisition of Mayer’s tenure as CEO. Through this acquisition, Mayer hoped to revive Yahoo! by expanding the company’s audience and supporting its long-declining advertising business. However, she managed the company very badly. Mayer set unjustified and inflated sales targets, appointed new executives who did not understand Tumblr’s business and were incompetent, and disrespect Tumblr’s former managers the in meetings. These poor management practises greatly reduced the motivation of Tumblr employees and led to a large number of employee departures (Fiegerman, 2016). With such a depressing atmosphere and mismanagement practises, Tumblr’s original employees were found to be very negative about the future of the company.</p>
<p>The failure of Tumblr was also due to Yahoo!’s lack of attention to the Tumblr product. After Yahoo! acquired Tumblr, its focus has been on how to use Tumblr to generate more advertising revenue, without a proper plan for Tumblr programming. Tumblr was once synonymous with GIFs and had the potential to become a great social media community. However, after Yahoo! bought it, it lost the chance to move forward. Yahoo’s executives presented a confusing vision of “create the next generation PDF”, without playing to Tumblr’s existing strengths or even iterating on Tumblr. Due to the lack of new product functions, Tumblr’s market is rapidly being replaced by new companies such as Snapchat, Medium and Giphy. The growth is being derailed. In the gradual decline of Tumblr, Yahoo! seemed completely unaware of their mistakes in managing Tumblr and continued to focus on using the Tumblr platform to serve advertisers. This lack of strategic strategy led to the eventual failure of the Tumblr acquisition. Yahoo! was not able to capitalise on Tumblr’s own strengths and capture the social media market, nor did it receive the advertising revenue it had hoped for, as the Tumblr platform was not suitable for advertising (Fiegerman, 2016).</p>
<h1 id="Failed-attempts-in-the-mobile-era"><a href="#Failed-attempts-in-the-mobile-era" class="headerlink" title="Failed attempts in the mobile era"></a><strong>Failed attempts in the mobile era</strong></h1><p>Yahoo!’s lag in mobile was almost predictable. Yahoo rejected Google’s bid because they did not recognise what new search engine technology could do for them in the future. Yahoo!’s unclear positioning between media and technology had kept it behind other competitors’ explorations on the technology side. Therefore, it quickly fell behind the times when the mobile era arrived. By the time Mayer took over as CEO, Yahoo!’s mobile applications were almost non-existent. And this is the fifth year of the smartphone era (Frick, 2016).</p>
<p>When Mayer took over Yahoo!, she recognised Yahoo!’s problems on mobile. But it was too late for Yahoo! to catch up for Google already had a significant dominant position in the mobile market with its Android system. So, Mayer decided to focus on the apps themselves (Vara, 2016).</p>
<p>This approach failed. Due to its earlier misdirection, <strong>Yahoo! did not hire enough mobile engineers and the programming language used by its engineers was so homogeneous that out of touch with the mobile market.</strong> To address the lack of talent, Mayer went on a hiring spree, even through acquisitions (Vara, 2016). However, as mentioned above, these unsuccessful acquisitions made the situation even worse.</p>
<p>Yahoo! did bad at the app design, either. It has invested too many resources in too many apps when it is wise to focus on making some apps great (Vara, 2016). This is what was mentioned earlier, as without proper service positioning, Yahoo! was serving in almost all areas and was beaten in almost all areas. Worse still, <strong>Yahoo! did not consider user needs and market demands when designing the app.</strong> For example, Yahoo Mail hardly made any facilitation design for sending and receiving emails on mobile, instead, it added a lot of information from Yahoo News and Yahoo Finance and made it another Yahoo Homepage. Yahoo News Digest made the same mistake. Yahoo News Digest, which has its roots in Summly, which cost 30 million, was one of Yahoo’s early attempts at app innovation. This news app provided users with daily news headlines, but does not offer customised content at all. No matter what area you are interested in, you will see the same content. As with Yahoo itself, much of the app’s failure seems to be due to an identity crisis: <strong>it is not clear who the app is supposed to serve.</strong> Serious news junkies want more than just a few stories a day, while fans of certain areas of interest need personalised recommendations (Bell, 2016). Unfortunately, Yahoo also does not do well.</p>
<p>From the above explanation, this article shows the reason why Yahoo! failed. <u>It did not find the right position for its company and service. Yahoo! ignore the power of high technology and did not have a long-term vision for its future, thus missing many opportunities to succeed. What’ s more, this company have a poor management as it changed leaders so frequently and fail to gain benefit from its acquisitions.</u> </p>
